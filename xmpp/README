1. This XMPP implementation is designed for bot-to-bot communication
   and includes some features that are not defined in any XEP yet.

2. The plugin structure needs more doc how to implement a XEP in a
   plugin. But the plugin system should be power full enough for most
   existing XEPs.

3. This implementation is only tested against ejabberd 2.0 as server
   and itself as client. Please report any bugs to the freevo-devel
   mailing list.
