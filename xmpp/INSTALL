Requirements:
-------------

- Python 2.5 or higher. Python 3 will not work

- kaa.base from SVN

- tlslite for e2e security (optional)
  (jingle-streams / link-local)

  I do not like tlslite as dependency, but while both OpenSSL and
  GnuTLS support SRP and OpenGPG, the Python bindings for those libs
  do not. Tlslite is the only Python library I could find that
  supports TLS-SRP.

- Avahi
- Dbus Daemon
- Dbus-Python

  If you do not have these libs/apps installed, link local
  communication will not work. Support for other mDNS libs should be
  done in kaa.base (kaa.net.mdns)
