1. Add padding information to Widget that can be set with a property
   in the XML file or with set/get functions. If padding is used,
   widgets like the grid should honor them.

2. Add a layout container so children do not need to have x/y values set.
   This widget also has to honor padding information

3. Update src/libcandy/clutter-reflect-texture.c to the code used in the
   tidy reflection actor.


X. All FIXME, TODO and @todo messages in the code should be fixed. And add
   more doc (always a good idea)
