o Symlinks again
o When client loses connection and has monitored queries, when client regains
  connection, queries don't get reactivated.
o Having a symbolic link in a dir pointing to itself 'ln -s . foo' confuses 
  crawler and causes 100% cpu usage (yes, I actually have a real directory 
  like this :))
