1. Support DVD directories

2. Update Monitor class

   o Handle dirname searches on directories not monitored by inotify

   o Check parents on file updates (cover?). Or is this not needed
     beacuse of the crawler?

3. Update doc

4. Set rom drive speed

5. Move special_exts in File._beacon_mtime to kaa.metadata

6. Use inotify on overlay directories

7. Try to reduce algorithm complexity in certain places.  e.g. maybe Query
   objects keep a dict of items keyed on url rather than a sorted item list.

8. Support yield_execution from kaa.db.query

9. Ability to give changes back to the caller in stages; useful for doing
   live queries while a user is typing in a word.

A. When an image is deleted, beacon should delete any corresponding thumbnail.

B. When a file is growing (copy, download), the code checks in a
   small interval. This is good and what we want, but we don't want
   new thumbnails (screenshots) while the download / copy is not
   complete.
