1. Support DVD directories

2. Update Monitor class

   o Handle dirname searches on directories not monitored by inotify

   o Check parents on file updates (cover?). Or is this not needed
     beacuse of the crawler?

3. Update doc

4. Support information in hidden directories. The free-desktop standard
   says that title and images about a directory can be stored inside
   a .directory dir inside the dir. So on every change in this dir 
   (that doesn't need to be scanned but needs inotify) we need to
   rescan the directory itself.

5. Move special_exts in File._beacon_mtime to kaa.metadata

6. Use inotify on overlay directories

7. Try to reduce algorithm complexity in certain places.  e.g. maybe Query
   objects keep a dict of items keyed on url rather than a sorted item list.

8. Support yield_execution from kaa.db.query

9. Ability to give changes back to the caller in stages; useful for doing
   live queries while a user is typing in a word.

A. When an image is deleted, beacon should delete any corresponding thumbnail.

B. When a file is growing (copy, download), the code checks in a
   small interval. This is good and what we want, but we don't want
   new thumbnails (screenshots) while the download / copy is not
   complete.
