1. Support DVD directories

   Right now it works a little bit. But if a dir is a DVD dump, there
   is no inotify support in the VIDEO_TS subdir.

2. Update Monitor class

   o Handle dirname searches on directories not monitored by inotify

   o Check parents on file updates (cover?). Or is this not needed
     beacuse of the crawler?

3. Update doc

4. Set rom drive speed

5. Move special_exts in File._beacon_mtime to kaa.metadata

6. Use inotify on overlay directories

7. Try to reduce algorithm complexity in certain places.  e.g. maybe Query
   objects keep a dict of items keyed on url rather than a sorted item list.

8. Support yield_execution from kaa.db.query

9. Ability to give changes back to the caller in stages; useful for doing
   live queries while a user is typing in a word.

A. When an image is deleted, beacon should delete any corresponding thumbnail.

B. When a file is growing (copy, download), the code checks in a
   small interval. This is good and what we want, but we don't want
   new thumbnails (screenshots) while the download / copy is not
   complete.

C. Subject: Music: cover art per album

   Freevo is currently looking for a cover.jpg or (filename).jpg file
   to display as cover art. However, it would be great if it can also
   look for files called (ID3AlbumName).jpg. This will allow users to
   store music from several albums in a single directory.
