1. Improve image loading (see notes in image.py)

2. Port clutter-reflect to current clutter API

3. Check if the Clutter Layoutmanager could be integrated

X. All FIXME, TODO and @todo messages in the code should be fixed. And add
   more doc (always a good idea)

Y. Re-check thread saftly; maybe make it cleaner
