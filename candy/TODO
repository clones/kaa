1. Add padding information to Widget that can be set with a property
   in the XML file or with set/get functions. If padding is used,
   widgets like the grid should honor them.

2. Add a layout container so children do not need to have x/y values set.
   This widget also has to honor padding information

3. Use the height parameter in Label. If font size is not given, calculate
   it based on height. If both are given, add additional valign parameter
   (top, center, bottom)

X. All FIXME, TODO and @todo messages in the code should be fixed. And add
   more doc (always a good idea)
