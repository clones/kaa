kaa-evas - python module for Evas
=================================

About
-----

kaa-evas is a python module for Evas, a canvas library written for the
Enlightenment project.  This module is not complete. 

kaa-evas requires CVS evas:

   http://www.enlightenment.org/Enlightenment/Get_Enlightenment/index.html

You can also use 0.9.9.011, if it's released:

   http://enlightenment.freedesktop.org/ 

To use kaa-evas with X11, you will need kaa-display.  The only Evas engine
kaa-evas supports natively is the buffer engine (and it is required for
building kaa-evas).

kaa-evas requires kaa-base.
