kaa-evas - python module for Evas
=================================

About
-----

kaa-evas is a python module for Evas, a canvas library written for the
Enlightenment project.  This module is not complete. 

kaa-evas requires evas >= 0.9.9.022:

   http://www.enlightenment.org/Enlightenment/Get_Enlightenment/index.html

The DirectFB support is broken in that release and not fixed in current cvs. 

To use kaa-evas with X11, you will need kaa-display.  The only Evas engine
kaa-evas supports natively is the buffer engine (and it is required for
building kaa-evas).

kaa-evas requires kaa-base.


Installation
