Dynamic loading without importing everything from __init__

Make everything faster :)

Add more types and information.

Create a REAME

Update inline docs

Move external submodules like eyeD3 and the discID code to an extra
dir lib to serperate our code from external modules we just copy.

Create doc in the Wiki and dump it into the doc subdir

Add list of external files kaa.vfs should know about

Move some code from mediainfo to media/core.py See image/core.py as
example.

Check attributes. Some are very similar and could be merged

Cleanup stuff about what is stored in the __dict__ and what is a
memeber variable. OK, after some thinking: MediaInfo should inherit
from dict. That is the only way we can support attributes with
whitespaces, etc. No more self.length, it is self['length'] in that
case. That means all parser have to be updated, maybe temp. in
WIP/metadata until it is done. THIS NEEDS CLEANUP!

If possible, attributes should match
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards_2fshared_2dfilemetadata_2dspec
and mime type should match
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Standards_2fshared_2dmime_2dinfo_2dspec
