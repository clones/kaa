Dynamic loading without importing everything from __init__

Make everything faster :)

Add more types and information. This includes removing using PIL to
support GIF and other image formats. Either create a gif parser or do
not support gif at all. The PIL stuff is evil.

Move the XML parser from Python XML to libxml Python bindings. This is
faster and this is also what other kaa modules use for XML.

Create a REAME

Every file needs a header and inline docs. Also correct the header to
point to the correct AUTHORS file.

Create doc in the Wiki and dump it into the doc subdir
