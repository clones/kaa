Dynamic loading without importing everything from __init__

Make everything faster :)

Add more types and information.

Move the XML parser from Python XML to libxml Python bindings. This is

Create a REAME

Every file needs a header and inline docs. Also correct the header to
point to the correct AUTHORS file.

Create doc in the Wiki and dump it into the doc subdir
