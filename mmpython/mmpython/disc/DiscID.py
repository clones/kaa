# Module for fetching information about an audio compact disc and
# returning it in a format friendly to CDDB.

# If called from the command line, will print out disc info in a
# format identical to Robert Woodcock's 'cd-discid' program.

# $Log$
# Revision 1.1  2005/05/07 11:49:10  dischi
# restruture code base
#
# Revision 1.4  2004/11/14 19:26:38  dischi
# fix future warning

# Revision 1.3  2003/06/23 19:26:16  dischi
# Fixed bug in the cdrommodule that the file was not closed after usage.
# The result was a drive you can't eject while the program (e.g. Freevo)
# is running. Added cvs log for DiscID and cdrommodule to keep track of
# all changes we did for mmpython.
