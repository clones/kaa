Here a small list of items for 0.5

o Move verything in a subdir mmpython except mminfo. This would make
  it possible to start mminfo without any hacks.
o Cleanup: 
  - create smaller header (see freevo)
  - use freevo coding style
  - remove the valid variable and replace it by an exception on error
o Move base objects into the different subdirs
o Dynamic loading without importing everything from __init__
o Update dvdinfo.py and the internal C module to get rid of using
  lsdvd internaly
o Make everything faster :)
o Add more types and information
