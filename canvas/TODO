Make it possible to have variables in the XML input for the canvas
system (XML template, maybe based on or similar to Kid)

Fonts can be either imlib2 or evas based. Using imlib2 makes fading
possible but evas has nice extra effects. I'm still not sure what to
do. The best would be to add fade out as evas feature inside the
enlightenment evas code.

The DirectFB code is not working because there is a bug in evas (last
time we checked). The bug is that evas frees memeory from kaa.canvas
or kaa.xine (I have no idea) and this causes a double free. Contact
was Jorge Luis Zapata Muga <jorgeluis.zapata@gmail.com>.

The transparent code is a bit strange. Sometimes alpha works with GL
and not FB and sometimes the other way around. Tack knows a better
description of this bug.

Maybe move the SVG and/or MNG code to kaa.imlib2
