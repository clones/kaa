Removing and adding the same object in a container in the same step
doesn't show the object.

Object._get_intrinsic_size gets no argument (except self) but is
called around line 229 of the same file with child_asking.

When the layer for container is set, shouldn't the objects in it be at
the same layer? Or at least adjust them.
