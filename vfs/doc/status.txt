The basic stuff is working. Some things are broken (FIXME)
and some need more work (TODO).

HUGE PROBLEM in db.py:

 # FIXME: for some very very strange reason this can take about
 # 2 seconds for 700 files. I'm not sure why. Some files are
 # processed and then python changes the thread to a new one. Only
 # the main thread is running right now and this thread is polling
 # using step() and step uses a select which should release the
 # interpreter lock. But this does not happen, the main thread is
 # doing _blocking_ selects (nothing to read) for up to 2 seconds
 # and this thread can't do anything. Maybe using a thread for db
 # access is not such a good thing afterall.
 # Note: for some more stranger reason the problem starts the same
 # moment when the client is sending the query to the server to do
 # the same query.

FIXME:

monitor/checker:
o a constantly growing file like a recording will result in
  a huge db activity on both client and server because checker calls
  update again and the mtime changed.

cdrom:
o the checker will block the threads or database, no idea where the
  problem ist.

TODO:

all:
o handle items not based on files like rom drives are tracks
o add overlay support
o support queries like all files with artist = foo.


client:
o reuse Query with same 'query'

item:
o cleanup variables in Item()

monitor:
o monitor all kinds of queries
o use inotify if possible, but it should also work without
