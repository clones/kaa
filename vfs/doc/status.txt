The basic stuff is working. Some things are broken (FIXME)
and some need more work (TODO).

FIXME:

monitor/checker:
o a constantly growing file like a recording will result in
  a huge db activity on both client and server because checker calls
  update again and the mtime changed.


TODO:

all:
o handle items not based on files like rom drives are tracks
o add overlay support

client:
o reuse Query with same 'query'

item:
o cleanup variables in Item()

monitor:
o monitor all kinds of queries
o use inotify if possible, but it should also work without
