I use this file for now for some findings:

mplayer

+ many filter
+ supports X, fb, directfb, mga and many other vo
- no changes of the filter chain during runtime
- no dvd menus
- no way to add filtrs not in the mplayer binary. This means Jasons
  overlay filter has to be shipped with a release


xine

+ overlay support
+ supports X, fb, directfb and vidixfb
+ change filter during runtime
- limited (but maybe enough) filters
- when started with a given window, xine does not resize the video the
  fit the video
- no real software scaler. This means (I guess) that kaa.canvas has to
  scale to fit the video. Without a software scaler, xine is more or
  less useless.


gstreamer

+ many filter
+ change filter during runtime
- supports only xv and x for now
- no overlay filter
- the doc sucks
