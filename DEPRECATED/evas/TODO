The DirectFB code is not working because there is a bug in evas (last
time we checked). The bug is that evas frees memeory from kaa.canvas
or kaa.xine (I have no idea) and this causes a double free. Contact
was Jorge Luis Zapata Muga <jorgeluis.zapata@gmail.com>.

Every file needs a header and inline docs. Also correct the header to
point to the correct AUTHORS file.

Create doc in the Wiki and dump it into the doc subdir
