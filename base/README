This module contains some basic code needed in all kaa modules. This
is a requirement for all the other modules in the repository.

The module also contains a mainloop. Some kaa modules like kaa-Display
require the mainloop to be running, for other modules like kaa-Thumb
it's optional and some like kaa-Metadata don't need the mainloop at
all. The documentation of the module should explain if and why the
mainloop is needed. If you already have a mainloop running, please
read SourceDoc/MainLoop how to merge the mainloop you use with the
kaa mainloop.
