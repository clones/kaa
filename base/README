This module contains some basic code needed in all kaa modules. This
is a requirement for all the other modules in the repository.

The module also contains a main loop (notifier). Some kaa modules like
kaa-Display require the main loop to be running, for other modules
like kaa-Thumb it's optional and some like kaa-Metadata don't need the
main loop at all. The documentation of the module should explain if
and why the main loop is needed. If you already have a main loop
running, please read SourceDoc/MainLoop how to merge the main loop you
use with the kaa main loop.
