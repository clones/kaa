The API for kaa.notifier has changed in releases 0.3.0 and 0.4.0. We
think the API is now stable again. You need to check your code to
adjust to the new API.


Changes for 0.3.0
-----------------

1. Rename kaa.notifier mainloop control:
   kaa.notifier.init() is kaa.main.select_notifier()
   kaa.notifier.loop() and kaa.main() is now kaa.main.run()
   kaa.notifier.step() is kaa.main.step()
   kaa.notifier.shutdown() is kaa.main.stop()
   kaa.notifier.running is kaa.main.is_running()
   kaa.notifier.signals (shutdown/step) are now kaa.main.signals
   
   kaa.main can be accessed by importing kaa, you can NOT import
   kaa.main directly.

2. Move kaa.notifier classes and functions into the kaa namespace.
   E.g. kaa.notifier.Timer is now kaa.Timer. No part of the code
   should use anything from kaa.notifier.

   Note: Exception for this is kaa.notifier.url right now

3. Renamed ThreadCallback to NamedThreadCallback and make the first
   paramater in __init__ the thread information (name or list of name
   and priority). The register function will be changed to __call__.
   The NamedThreadCallback is not InProgress object anymore, it is a
   Callback. In most cases ThreadCallback was not used directly so
   this API change should not break some code.

4. Renamed Thread to ThreadCallback. The class has no signals anymore
   and the start function is now __call__ and it will return an
   InProgress object.

5. Rename exception_handler in InProgress into exception and the
   exception callback function to throw. Add a convenience function 
   connect_both. The member variable is_finished is now a function.

6. yield_execution decorator: lock kwarg was renamed to synchronize

7. All exception handlers now take three arguments (instead of one): 
   exception type, exception value, traceback.

8. yield_execution now always returns an InProgress object. This
   InProgress object may already be finished. Using yield on a
   finished object will return without waiting. For Python 2.5 the
   yield also returns the value or can raise an exception.


Changes for 0.4.0
-----------------

1. MainThreadCallback.set_async() is removed.  Calling a 
   MainThreadCallback will return an InProgress object, and the
   new approach now is to wait() on this InProgress.

2. Several decorators renamed:
      @kaa.execute_in_timer  -->  @kaa.timed
      @kaa.execute_in_thread  -->  @kaa.threaded
      @kaa.execute_in_mainloop  --> @kaa.threaded(kaa.MAINTHREAD)
      @kaa.yield_execution  -->  @kaa.coroutine

   Currently the old names are still functional but a warning will be
   logged if they are used. @kaa.timed also changed the parameter
   order and name. It is now interval, timer (default Timer) and
   policy (default POLICY_RESTART).
