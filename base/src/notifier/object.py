    Base class for kaa objects.

    This class contains logic to convert the __kaasignals__ class attribute
    (a dict) into a signals instance attribute (a kaa.Signals object).

    __kaasignals__ is a dict whose key is the name of the signal, and value
    a docstring.  The dict and docstring should be formatted like so::

        ___kaasignals__ = {
            'example':
                '''
                Single short line describing the signal.

                .. describe:: def callback(arg1, arg2, ...)

                   :param arg1: Description of arg1
                   :type arg1: str
                   :param arg2: Description of arg2
                   :type arg2: bool

                A more detailed description of the signal, if necessary, follows.
                ''',

            'another':
                '''
                Docstring similar to the above example.  Note the blank line
                separating signal stanzas.
                '''
        }

    It is possible for a subclass to remove a signal provided by its superclass
    by setting the dict value to None.  e.g.::

        __kaasignals__ = {
            'newsignal':
                '''
                New signal provided by this subclass.
                ''',

            # This ensures the signal 'supersignal' does not appear in the
            # current class's kaa.Signals object.  (It does not affect the
            # superclass.)
            'supersignal': None
        }
    """
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Accept all args, and pass to superclass.  Necessary for kaa.Object
        # descendants to be involved in inheritance diamonds.
        super(Object, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        signals = get_all_signals(self.__class__)
        if signals:
            # Import Signals late to allow circular importing.
            from signals import Signals
            # Construct the kaa.Signals object and attach the docstrings to
            # each signal in the Signal object's __doc__ attribute.
            self.signals = Signals(*signals.keys())
            for name in signals:
                self.signals[name].__doc__ = signals[name]
