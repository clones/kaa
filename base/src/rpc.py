# rpc.py - Simple RPC InterProcessCommunication
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# $Id$
#
# This module defines an alternative way for InterProcessCommunication with
# less features than the ipc.py module. It does not keep references, return
# values are only given back as a callback and it is only possible to access
# functions.
#
# So wy use this module and not kaa.ipc? Well, kaa.ipc makes it very easy to
# shoot yourself into the foot. It keeps references over ipc which could
# confuse the garbage collector and a simple function call on an object can
# result in many notifier steps incl. recursion inside the notifier.
#
#
# Documentation:
#
# Start a server: kaa.rpc.Server(address, secret)
# Start a client: kaa.rpc.Client(address, secret)
#
# Since everything is async, the challenge response is done in the background
# and you can start using it right away. If the authentication is wrong, it
# will fail without notifing the user (I know this is bad, but it is designed
# to work internaly where everything is correct).
#
# Next you need to define functions the remote side is allowed to call and
# give it a name. Use use expose for that.
#
# | class MyClass(object)
# |   @kaa.rpc.expose("do_something")
# |   def my_function(self, foo)
#
# Connect the object with that function to the server/client. You can connect
# as many objects as you want
# | server.connect(MyClass())
#
# The client can now call do_something (not my_function, this is the internal
# name). To do that, you need to create a RPC object with the callback you
# want to have
#
# | x = client.rpc('do_something', 6) or
# | x = client.rpc('do_something', foo=4)
#
# The result is an InProgress object. Connect to it to get the result.
#
# When a new client connects to the server, the 'client_connected' signals will
# be emitted with a Channel object as parameter. This object can be used to
# call functions on client side the same way the client calls functions on
# server side. The client and the channel objects have a signal 'disconnected'
# to be called when the connection gets lost.

        This function handles any packet received by the remote end while we
        are waiting for authentication.  It responds to AUTH or RESP packets
        (auth packets) while closing the connection on all other packets (non-
        auth packets).

        Design goals of authentication:
           * prevent unauthenticated connections from executing RPC commands
             other than 'auth' commands.
           * prevent unauthenticated connections from causing denial-of-
             service at or above the RPC layer.
           * prevent third parties from learning the shared secret by
             eavesdropping the channel.

        Non-goals:
           * provide any level of security whatsoever subsequent to successful
             authentication.
           * detect in-transit tampering of authentication by third parties
             (and thus preventing successful authentication).

        The parameters 'seq' and 'type' are untainted and safe.  The parameter
        payload is potentially dangerous and this function must handle any
        possible malformed payload gracefully.

        Authentication is a 4 step process and once it has succeeded, both
        sides should be assured that they share the same authentication secret.
        It uses a challenge-response scheme similar to CRAM.  The party
        responding to a challenge will hash the response with a locally
        generated salt to prevent a Chosen Plaintext Attack.  (Although CPA is
        not very practical, as they require the client to connect to a rogue
        server.) The server initiates authentication.

           1. Server sends challenge to client (AUTH packet)
           2. Client receives challenge, computes response, generates a
              counter-challenge and sends both to the server in reply (RESP
              packet with non-null challenge).
           3. Server receives response to its challenge in step 1 and the
              counter-challenge from server in step 2.  Server validates
              client's response.  If it fails, server logs the error and
              disconnects.  If it succeeds, server sends response to client's
              counter-challenge (RESP packet with null challenge).  At this
              point server considers client authenticated and allows it to send
              non-auth packets.
           4. Client receives server's response and validates it.  If it fails,
              it disconnects immediately.  If it succeeds, it allows the server
              to send non-auth packets.

        Step 1 happens when a new connection is initiated.  Steps 2-4 happen in
        this function.  3 packets are sent in this handshake (steps 1-3).

        WARNING: once authentication succeeds, there is implicit full trust.
        There is no security after that point, and it should be assumed that
        the client can invoke arbitrary calls on the server, and vice versa,
        because no effort is made to validate the data on the channel.

        Also, individual packets aren't authenticated.  Once each side has
        sucessfully authenticated, this scheme cannot protect against
        hijacking or denial-of-service attacks.

        One goal is to restrict the code path taken packets sent by
        unauthenticated connections.  That path is:

           _handle_read() -> _handle_packet_before_auth()
