    Decorator to call the decorated function in a Timer. When calling the
    function, a timer will be started with the given interval calling that
    function.  The decorated function will be called from the main thread.

    The timer parameter optionally specifies which timer class should be
    used to wrap the function.  kaa.Timer (default) or kaa.WeakTimer will
    repeatedly invoke the decorated function until it returns False.
    kaa.OneShotTimer or kaa.WeakOneShotTimer will invoke the function once,
    delaying it by the specified interval.  (In this case the return value
    of the decorated function is irrelevant.)

    The policy parameter controls how multiple invocations of the decorated
    function should be handled.  By default (POLICY_MANY), each invocation of
    the function will create a new timer, each firing at the specified
    interval.  If policy is POLICY_ONCE, subsequent invocations are ignored
    while the first timer is still active.  If the policy is POLICY_RESTART,
    subsequent invocations will restart the first timer.

    Note that in the case of POLICY_ONCE or POLICY_RESTART, if the timer is
    currently running, any arguments passed to the decorated function on
    subsequent calls will be discarded.
