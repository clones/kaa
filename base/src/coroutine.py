# $Id$
#
# This file contains a decorator usefull for functions that may need more
# time to execute and that needs more than one step to fullfill the task.
#
# A caller of a function decorated with 'coroutine' will either get the
# return value of the function call or an InProgress object in return. The
# first is similar to a normal function call, if an InProgress object is
# returned, this means that the function is still running. The object has a
# 'connect' function to connect a callback to get the results of the function
# call when it is done.
#
# A function decorated with 'coroutine' can't use 'return' to return the
# result of the function call. Instead it has to use yield to do this. Besides
# a normal return, the function can also return 'NotFinished' in the yield
# statement. In that case, the function call continues at this point in the
# next main loop iteration. If the function itself has to wait for a result of
# a function call (either another yield function are something else working
# async with an InProgress object) and it can create a 'InProgressCallback'
# object and use this as callback.
#
# The 'coroutine' decorator has a parameter interval. This is the
# interval used to schedule when the function should continue after a yield.
# The default value is 0, the first iteration is always called without a timer.

    Decorated functions (which must be generators) may yield control
    back to the mainloop and be subsequently resumed at a later time.

    Functions which yield ``kaa.NotFinished`` will be resumed on the
    next mainloop iteration; yielding an :class:`~kaa.InProgress` object
    will cause the coroutine to be resumed when the InProgress is finished.
    However, yielding a *finished* InProgress object will cause the coroutine
    to be resumed immediately.

    The coroutine is considered finished when the underlying generator yields
    a value other than ``kaa.NotFinished`` or an InProgress object.

    :param interval: Number of seconds to delay before resuming entry into
                     the coroutine.  Set to 0 (default) to resume as soon as
                     possible (but not sooner than the next mainloop iteration).
    :param policy: None, or one of ``POLICY_SYNCHRONIZED``, ``POLICY_SINGLETON``, or
                   ``POLICY_PASS_LAST`` (described below).
    :param progress: if True, a Progress object is passed as the first argument to
                     the decorated function, allowing the coroutine to report progress
                     to the caller.  (The progress parameter corresponds to the
                     ``progress`` attribute of the InProgress object returned to
                     the caller.)
    :param group: Name of the group this coroutine shares its policy with.  For
                  example, multiple coroutines with POLICY_SYNCHRONIZED and the
                  same group name will all be synchronized against each other.
    :return: an :class:`~kaa.InProgress` object representing the coroutine.

    Possible policies are:

        * ``kaa.POLICY_SYNCHRONIZED``: reentry into the coroutine is not permitted,
          and multiple calls are queued so that they execute sequentially.
        * ``kaa.POLICY_SINGLETON``: only one active instance of the coroutine is allowed
          to exist.  If the coroutine is invoked while another is running,
          the CoroutineInProgress object returned by the first invocation
          until it finishes.
        * ``kaa.POLICY_PASS_LAST``: passes the CoroutineInProgress of the most recently
          called, unfinished invocation of this coroutine as the 'last'
          kwarg.  If no such CoroutineInProgress exists, the last kwarg will
          be None.  This is useful to chain multiple invocations of the
          coroutine together, but unlike ``POLICY_SYNCHRONIZED``, the decorated
          function is entered each invocation.

    A function decorated with this decorator will always return an
    :class:`~kaa.InProgress` object. It may already be finished (which happens if
    the coroutine's first yielded value is one other than ``kaa.NotFinished`` or  
    an InProgress object).
    
    If it is not finished, the coroutine's life can be controlled via the
    :class:`~kaa.InProgress` it returns.  It can be :meth:`~kaa.InProgress.abort`ed,
    in which case a GeneratorExit will be raised inside the coroutine, or its
    interval may be adjusted via the :attr:`~kaa.CoroutineInProgress.interval` 
    property.
