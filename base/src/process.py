        Handler for SIGCHLD.  We invoke this as a OneShotTimer so that we get called
        on the next pass of the mainloop.  If SIGCHLD just interrupted the select
        call in pynotifier, then the following sequence occurs:

           1. SIGCHLD received, and Python's internal C sig handler then
              queues the python handler to run after the bytecode that called
              Python select() completes
           2. low level (C) select() aborts with EINTR (because select ignores
              SA_RESTART bit) and select_error exception is set (but not
              raised into Python yet)
           3. The bytecode responsible for calling select() completes and the
              queued Python SIGCHLD handler is invoked (this is before the
              select_error is raised into Python space).
           4. The @timed decorator wrapper is called (asynchronously), which
              creates a new OneShotTimer to invoke this method
              (_sigchld_handler) in 0s.
           5. Python select() call finally raises select_error with EINTR,
              which is caught and ignored by pynotifier.
           6. pynotifier proceeds to fire any pending timers, and so the timer
              that was just added to call _sigchld_handler is invoked,
              and Bob's your uncle.

        For system calls (such as read()) that _do_ honor the SA_RESTART bit,
        the sequence looks a bit different:

           1. Same #1 as above (except replace select() with whatever system
              call is properly restarted thanks to SA_RESTART)
           2. System call is restarted (presumably within the kernel).
           3. The bytecode responsible for calling the system call completes.
           4. Before the return value is passed back into Python space, the
              queued python handler (@timed decorator wrapper) is called
              asynchronously as in #4 above.
           5. The system call's return value is passed back into Python 
              space as if nothing was interrupted, except now our timer is
              queued.
           6. Next mainloop iteration, select() is called with a 0 timeout;
              then #6 as above.
             
        We _might_ get away fine with not using a timer to call the real
        _sigchld_handler, but as the signal handler is called asynchronously,
        it is safest and most predictable to do as little as possible,
        especially as Process._check_dead() might involve some fairly complex
        paths.
