class IOChannel(Object):
    """
    Base class for read-only, write-only or read-write descriptors such as
    Socket and Process.  Implements logic common to communication over
    such channels such as async read/writes and read/write buffering.

    It may also be used directly with file descriptors or file-like objects.
    e.g. ``IOChannel(file('somefile'))``

    :param channel: file descriptor to wrap into an IOChannel
    :type channel: integer file descriptor, file-like object, or other IOChannel
    :param mode: indicates whether the channel is readable, writable, or both.
    :type mode: bitmask of kaa.IO_READ and/or kaa.IO_WRITE
    :param chunk_size: maximum number of bytes to be read in from the channel
                       at a time; defaults to 1M.
    :param delimiter: string used to split data for use with readline; defaults
                      to '\\\\n'.

    Writes may be performed to an IOChannel that is not yet open.  These writes
    will be queued until the queue size limit (controlled by the
    :attr:`~kaa.IOChannel.queue_size` property) is reached, after which an
    exception will be raised.  The write queue will be written to the channel
    once it becomes writable.

    Reads are asynchronous and non-blocking, and may be performed using two
    possible approaches:

        1. Connecting a callback to the :attr:`~kaa.IOChannel.signals.read` 
           or :attr:`~kaa.IOChannel.signals.readline` signals.
        2. Invoking the :meth:`~kaa.IOChannel.read` or
           :meth:`~kaa.IOChannel.readline` methods, which return
           :class:`~kaa.InProgress` objects.

    It is not possible to use both approaches with readline.  (That is, it
    is not permitted to connect a callback to the *readline* signal and
    subsequently invoke the :meth:`~kaa.IOChannel.readline` method when the
    callback is still connected.)

    However, :meth:`~kaa.IOChannel.read` and :meth:`~kaa.IOChannel.readline`
    will work predictably when a callback is connected to the *read* signal.
    Such a callback always receives all data from the channel once connected,
    but will not interfere with (or "steal" data from) calls to read() or
    readline().

    Data is not consumed from the channel if no one is interested in reads
    (that is, when there are no read() or readline() calls in progress, and
    there are no callbacks connected to the *read* and *readline* signals).
    This is necessary for flow control.

    Data is read from the channel in chunks, with the maximum chunk being
    defined by the :attr:`~kaa.IOChannel.queue_size` property.  Unlike other
    APIs, read() does not block and will not consume all data to the end of the
    channel, but rather returns between 0 and *chunk_size* bytes when it
    becomes available.  If read() returns a zero-byte string, it means the
    channel is closed.  (Here, "returns X" means the :class:`~kaa.InProgress`
    object read() actually returns is finished with X.)

    In order for readline to work properly, a read queue is maintained, which
    may grow up to *queue_size*.  See the :meth:`~kaa.IOChannel.readline` method
    for more details.
