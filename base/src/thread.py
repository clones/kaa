#
# This module contains some wrapper classes for threading while running the
# main loop. It should only be used when non blocking handling is not
# possible. The main loop itself is not thread save, the the function called in
# the thread should not touch any variables inside the application which are
# not protected by by a lock.
#
# You can create a Thread object with the function and it's
# arguments. After that you can call the start function to start the
# thread. This function has an optional parameter with a callable
# which will be called from the main loop once the thread is
# finished. The result of the thread function is the parameter for the
# callable.
#
# In most cases this module is not needed, please add a good reason why you
# wrap a function in a thread.

        exception is raised inside the thread.

        Callbacks connected to this signal are invoked within the thread from
        which ``abort()`` was called.  If any of the callbacks return

           up to 100 bytecodes for it to trigger within the thread.  This
