# glib.py - Glib (gobject mainloop) thread wrapper
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# $Id$
#
# This module makes it possible to run the glib mainloop in an extra thread
# and provides a hook to run callbacks in the glib thread. This module also
# supports using the glib mainloop as main mainloop. In that case, no threads
# are used.
#
# If you use this module to interact with a threaded glib mainloop, remember
# that callbacks from glib are also called from the glib thread.
