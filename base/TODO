TODO before 1.0:
----------------

- Remove getters and setters (in the form get_foo() and set_foo()), using
  instead properties.  This will result in significant API breakage, but
  is better to do that now than after 1.0 :)

    WeakCallback.set_weakref_destroyed_cb -> WeakCallback.weakref_destroyed_cb property
    CoroutineInProgress.set_interval -> CoroutineInProgress.interval property
    Database.add_object -> Database.add
    Database.update_object -> Database.update
    Database.query -> make it a coroutine
    ThreadCallback.wait_on_exit -> property instead of function

- Complete documentation

- Adjust code to new Process class to remove kaa.popen. The following
  parts in kaa uses kaa.Process: popcorn (requires rewrite anyway) and
  beacon in the video thumbnailer and cdrom.py to (u)mount. Freevo 2.0
  uses it in the tvserver plugins (dvbstreamer and mplayer), some
  small one-lines that should work with kaa.Process2 without changes,
  and the games code which is broken anyway. Freevo 1.x is not using
  it at all.


TODO either before or after 1.0:
--------------------------------

- Unit testing suite (preferably before)

- Eliminate explicit type() checking.  Even isinstance() should be avoided
  where possible, relying instead of duck typing.
