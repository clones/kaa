TODO before 1.0:

- Eliminate explicit type() checking.  Even isinstance() should be avoided
  where possible, relying instead of duck typing.
- Make sure SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt is not silently caught.  They
  should be bubbled up to the notifier loop.  In other words, do not
  use catch-all except statements, but rather 'except Exception' (which
  will not catch KeyboardInterrupt and SystemExit).
- Remove getters and setters (in the form get_foo() and set_foo()), using
  instead properties.  This will result in significant API breakage, but
  is better to do that now than after 1.0 :)
- Rewrite of Process class
- Complete documentation


TODO either before or after 1.0:
- Unit testing suite (preferably before)
