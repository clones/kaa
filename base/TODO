TODO before 1.0:

- Remove getters and setters (in the form get_foo() and set_foo()), using
  instead properties.  This will result in significant API breakage, but
  is better to do that now than after 1.0 :)
    - see TODO.api
- Complete documentation


DONE:
- Rewrite of Process class
- [?] Adjust kaa.distribution to not import anything from kaa itself. Right now
  svn2log.py imports kaa.xmlutils


TODO either before or after 1.0:
- Unit testing suite (preferably before)
- Eliminate explicit type() checking.  Even isinstance() should be avoided
  where possible, relying instead of duck typing.
