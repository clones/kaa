Move the classes from src/__init__.py into an extra file. The init
file should only import some other stuff without too much defining
inside.

Better opengl check. If EvasGL is used but the device is broken or the
user has no permission, the code will use the GL software renderer
which is _much_ slower than the evas x11 software render.

Maybe remove that bad pygame hack

Add more (evas based) displays like streaming the display as mpeg
stream. This could be done by using a buffer output and convert it to
mpeg2. This display can also be used to make it work with a DXR3 or
other mpeg decoder based cards.

Fix DirectFB Evas display. Please check if there is still a bug in
evas and help fixing it.

Create a REAME

Every file needs a header and inline docs. Also correct the header to
point to the correct AUTHORS file.

Create doc in the Wiki and dump it into the doc subdir
