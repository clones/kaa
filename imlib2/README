kaa-imlib2 - python module for Imlib2
=========================================

About
-----

Kaa-Imlib2 is a python module for Imlib2.  It is terribly incomplete.
Its main reason is to provide image manipulation routines for MeBox.

Only a small part of the Imlib2 API has been wrapped.  If you want to help by
adding more methods, patches will be happily accepted.


Requirements
-------------

Imlib2 >= 1.1.1
kaa.base


Installation
------------

Assuming you already have kaa.base and Imlib2 installed, you can
install kaa-imlib2 with:

	python setup.py install
