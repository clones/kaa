kaa-imlib2 - python module for Imlib2
=========================================

   NOTE: This isn't meant to be a formal release but rather just a demo
   of some of the stuff I'm working on.  As a result, it may suck
   unbelievably or be outright broken.


About
-----

Kaa-Imlib2 is a python module for Imlib2.  It is terribly incomplete.  Its
main raison d'Ãªtre is to provide image manipulation routines for MeBox.

Kaa-Imlib2 requires Imlib2 1.1.1 or later, which can be gotten here:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2&package_id=11130

I've packaged RPMs for both Imlib2 and kaa-imlib2 for convenience.  You can
download them, as well as the most recent version of kaa-imlib2 at:

   http://sault.org/mebox/downloads.php

Only a small part of the Imlib2 API has been wrapped.  If you want to help by
adding more methods, patches will be happily accepted.


Installation
------------

Assuming you already have Imlib2 installed, you can install kaa-imlib2 with:

	python setup.py install
